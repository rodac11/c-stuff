# c-stuff: the repo where I throw my c junk.
I'd like to get back into writing C, so I'm just throwing some basic stuff together to warm up to it.

## What's in here
So far:
### Csar.c (Caesar Cypher)
A super basic project that encrypts with the [Caesar Cypher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) I'm using a right-shift of three (the one Julius Caesar used). Lowercase letters get shifted into lowercase, same with uppercase. Non-letter characters ignored! Csar reads a message.txt file and prints the encrypted text.
### textfiles
Where I put my test txts.
